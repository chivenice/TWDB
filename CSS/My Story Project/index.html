          <h3 id="headline">Here's my story so far:</h3>
          <ul> 
            <li><strong>1997</strong> - 22:00 Born in Tu Du Hospital, Ho Chi Minh city, Vietnam</li>
            <li>
              <strong>2000</strong> - My father was a mechanical engineer, he worked for a Taiwan silicon company for 10 years before the change to his current job. His wage was good enough to buy me a karaoke player. And my mother loves music and she has been playing music to me since I was born. At an early age, I had listened to not only Vietnamese songs but also US pop songs such as "Baby Once More Time, I Want It That Way, etc...". Eventually, I fell in love with the music and confidently started singing along with some of my favorite songs at the age of 3.
            </li>
             <li>
              <strong>2003-2008</strong> - This was my elementary school years. I was a determinded kid loved watching TV commercial then made some experiment to check it. My mother told me that once I used dishwasher to clean my hair because they said the product could clean your dishes as clean as you wash your hair. Although I was really stubborn I never wanted to follow any rules from my mother, I enjoyed the way I got things done in my way. My other relative tole me that I was also good at Poker. They said once they cheated me on a game but I thought they made some mistakes so I told them to change those card before they had chance to cheat. 
            </li>
             <li>
              <strong>2006</strong> - I got my very first Dell computer as a birthday present from my dad. I still remember the feeling when I first saw a computer. The curiosity and excitement had run in my vein, and mother said she was so worried about me because I spent hours sitting in front of the screen and even my mother threatened to hit me if I would not leave the computer.
            </li>
              <li>
              <strong>2008</strong> - I can say that my life was good and normal as other kids. However, tons of stratery had been brought to my family in 2012. 3 words describe #losing #bully #money. Those personal experiences shaped my thought older than my age. Even though it was the most terrible year in my life, it makes me more powerful because I learn to getting over it and moving on for a better tomorrow. 
            </li>    
             <li>
              <strong>2008-2012</strong> - Junior Highschool Years: transformation, friendship, and curiosity. Those words precisely defined my time in school. I still remember the first day of grade 6, a boy told me to change my colorful cartoon-character-shoes because it was not NORMAL as compare to other girls. I had never had anyone tell me what to do except my mother so I felt shocked a little. However, thanks to him I could get away from the boorish old me to the better Chi in style. After all these years, we remain this friendship and we still keep in touch sometimes. In the bigger school, I met many students from different wards and became their friend. Thus, I had reason to visit their house but deep-down, I was curious about their neighborhood. Since we felt confident about calculation, we went to different coffee shops, cinemas, and food stores near the school. The school was very near to a supermarket too. Every Friday, after school, we visited different corners and stores in the supermarket and did crazy things. For example, trying on weird clothes which we never buy, playing hide and seek between the shop's queue. Most of all, having ice cream after the play was the thing we enjoyed the most.

              <strong>2012-2015</strong> - Soon as I got into high school, my family and I discussed my future plan. Like every parent, in particular, they wanted me to study hard in order to get a ticket to a good university in Ho Chi Minh. Luckily, I was selected to be in a special class where we highly focused on Mathematics, English, and Literature. 80% of students in the class had a really good foundation in the English language. Although I had a huge love for the language since I was a kid, I had never gotten good marks in the subject. Being with some excellent students built inferioty complex at first. However, by competing with them, I turned that fear into motivation that encouraged me to study harder.

              <strong>2015-now</strong> - Finally, I passed the university entrance test and had an offer from a university on my wish list. My parent was extremely happy for me and they gave me a trip to Japan as an effort payoff. Going to Japan had been such a dream since I was 6 years old. I had been watching many Japanese anime shows such as Doraemon, Conan-The Detective, and The Cardcaptor Sakura was my favorite. Japan is such an impressive country. I can tell a bunch of things I love about Japan like the convenient transportation system, amazing architecture, the balance of modern and traditional,... . That is why I insisted my family let me go and study in Japan.

I never was the kind of a woman who liked to get in the car and just go for a ride…. Do we have a destination? Do we have a plan? Or are we just riding?
