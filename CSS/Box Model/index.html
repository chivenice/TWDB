    <h1>Don’t We All Deserve More Vacation? </h1>

    <div id="one">Math has never been my forte but from the time I entered the working world, a certain ratio seemed
        deranged to me: most Americans are on the job for 50 weeks, and only off for two. In between my third and fourth
        years of college, I studied abroad and lived with a family of three in Valencia, Spain. They dropped in the
        apartment for mid-day siestas, as is Spanish custom, and fled to various beaches for four weeks in August. It
        seemed gloriously cushy compared to the American grind. I've heard past colleagues brag about not taking all of
        their vacation days (as if leaving money on the table is a sign of dedication). A recent viral tweet was funny
        because it's true (even if a little exaggeratory): European out-of-offices, it said, read something like: “I’m
        away camping for the summer. Email again in September," compared to workaholic American OOOs: “I have left the
        office for two hours to undergo kidney surgery but you can reach me on my cell anytime.”

        Some companies in the U.S. seem to be waking up to the mental health benefits of more vacation. Bumble has shut
        down all of its offices this week, giving 700 employees an extra paid, “fully offline” week of vacation. The
        female-forward dating app made its $8.3 billion-dollar debut on the stock market in February and founder Whitney
        Herd “correctly intuited our collective burnout,” according to a since-deleted tweet from Bumble's head of
        editorial content Clare O'Connor. “In the U.S. especially, where vacation days are notoriously scarce, it feels
        like a big deal.” As a spokesperson put it to CNBC: “Our global team has had a very challenging time during the
        pandemic. As vaccination rates have increased and restrictions have begun to ease, we wanted to give our teams
        around the world an opportunity to shut off and focus on themselves for a week.”

    <div id="three">In addition to normal vacation time, social media dashboard company Hootsuite will close its offices from July
        5 through 12 for a “Wellness Week” so employees can “‘unplug’ together.” The pandemic, “reminded us how
        important mental health is,” Hootsuite said, citing stressors from increased time spent online during
        quarantine, rises in “depression, anxiety, loneliness, and uncertainty,” as well as the disproportionate impact
        of COVID-19 on Black and Latino communities, and the weight of Black Lives Matter protests and hate crimes
        against the Asian-American community.</div>
