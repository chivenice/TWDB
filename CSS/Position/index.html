    <p>[Verse 1]
        She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
        I said, "Don't mind, but what do you mean, I am the one
        Who will dance on the floor in the round?"
        She said I am the one
        Who will dance on the floor in the round
        She told me her name was Billie Jean
        As she caused a scene
        Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of bein' the one
        Who will dance on the floor in the round
        
        [Pre-Chorus 1]
        People always told me, "Be careful of what you do
        Don't go around breakin' young girls' hearts" (Hee-hee)
        And mother always told me, "Be careful of who you love
        And be careful of what you do (Oh-oh)
        'Cause the lie becomes the truth" (Oh-oh)
        Hey-ay
        
        [Chorus]
        Billie Jean is not my lover
        She's just a girl who claims that I am the one (Oh, baby)
        But the kid is not my son, hoo!
        She says I am the one (Oh, baby)
        But the kid is not my son (Hee-hee-hee, no-no-no, hee-hee-hee)
        Hoo! </p>
