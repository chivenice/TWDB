    <h1>Crime and Punishment</h1>
    <p>This is a novel wirtten by Fyodor Dostoevsky</p>
    <h2>Main Ideas</h2>
    <h3>Themes</h3>
    <h4>Alienation from Society</h4>
    <p>Alienation is the primary theme of Crime and Punishment. At first, Raskolnikov’s pride separates him from
        society. He sees himself as superior to all other people and so cannot relate to anyone. Within his personal
        philosophy, he sees other people as tools and uses them for his own ends. After committing the murders, his
        isolation grows because of his intense guilt and the half-delirium into which his guilt throws him. Over and
        over again, Raskolnikov pushes away the people who are trying to help him, including Sonya, Dunya, Pulcheria
        Alexandrovna, Razumikhin, and even Porfiry Petrovich, and then suffers the consequences. In the end, he finds
        the total alienation that he has brought upon himself intolerable. Only in the Epilogue, when he finally
        realizes that he loves Sonya, does Raskolnikov break through the wall of pride and self-centeredness that has
        separated him from society.</p>

    <h4>The Psychology of Crime and Punishment</h4>
    <p>he manner in which the novel addresses crime and punishment is not exactly what one would expect. The crime is
        committed in Part I and the punishment comes hundreds of pages later, in the Epilogue. The real focus of the
        novel is not on those two endpoints but on what lies between them—an in-depth exploration of the psychology of a
        criminal. The inner world of Raskolnikov, with all of its doubts, deliria, second-guessing, fear, and despair,
        is the heart of the story. Dostoevsky concerns himself not with the actual repercussions of the murder but with
        the way the murder forces Raskolnikov to deal with tormenting guilt. Indeed, by focusing so little on
        Raskolnikov’s imprisonment, Dostoevsky seems to suggest that actual punishment is much less terrible than the
        stress and anxiety of trying to avoid punishment. Porfiry Petrovich emphasizes the psychological angle of the
        novel, as he shrewdly realizes that Raskolnikov is the killer and makes several speeches in which he details the
        workings of Raskolnikov’s mind after the killing. Because he understands that a guilt-ridden criminal must
        necessarily experience mental torture, he is certain that Raskolnikov will eventually confess or go mad. The
        expert mind games that he plays with Raskolnikov strengthen the sense that the novel’s outcome is inevitable
        because of the nature of the human psyche.</p>
